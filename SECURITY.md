# 🔐 Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in OmniSocial Hub:

1. **Do not open a public issue**
2. Contact the maintainers privately at: `contact@circuitryhubinsights.online`
3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Proof of concept (PoC)
   - Potential impact

We will coordinate with affected parties before we begin and aim to fix critical issues within 72 hours.
