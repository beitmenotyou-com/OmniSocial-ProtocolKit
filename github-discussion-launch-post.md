# ðŸš€ OmniSocial ProtocolKit Has Launched!

OmniSocial ProtocolKit is a community-built starter framework that unifies ActivityPub, AT Protocol, Nostr, and more into one powerful gateway for the decentralized web.

Built by the **Circuitry Hub Insights Collective**, this repo is designed to:

- Help developers bridge protocols (ActivityPub â†” Nostr, etc.)
- Create modular, pluggable protocol integrations
- Serve as a sandbox for standardizing decentralized identity and messaging
- Provide docs, proposals, and community feedback loops
