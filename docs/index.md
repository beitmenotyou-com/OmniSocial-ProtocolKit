## Welcome to OmniSocial ProtocolKit

OmniSocial ProtocolKit is a modular, self-hostable toolkit for building decentralized, censorship-resistant, and federated social media platforms. It integrates cross-protocol publishing, self-sovereign identity, Lightning monetization, federated messaging, and more.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

OmniSocial is built on:

- **Cross-Protocol Publishing** – Post once, publish to ActivityPub, ATProto, Nostr, RSS, and more.
- **Self-Sovereign Identity** – Unified identity using DIDs, Webfinger, Matrix, Lightning, and Nostr.
- **Federated Messaging** – Encrypted Matrix-based DMs and group chat.
- **Lightning Monetization** – Anti-spam, tipping, paywalls — all with Lightning Network.
- **Modular Plugins** – Extend with protocol modules, storage backends, moderation tools.
- **Decentralized Storage** – IPFS, Arweave, Solid support.
- **Unified Feed Engine** – Aggregates posts from all federated protocols.

---

## 🛠 Installation Guide

Deploy OmniSocial locally or to production:

### Requirements
- Docker
- Git

### Local Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/beitmenotyou-com/OmniSocial-ProtocolKit.git
cd OmniSocial-ProtocolKit
docker-compose up
```

### Production
- [Docker-based Deployment Guide](https://github.com/beitmenotyou-com/OmniSocial-ProtocolKit/wiki/Install-Guide)

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

OmniSocial is built on modular, interoperable components:

- **Core Engine** – Handles routing, identity, plugin management.
- **Protocol Modules** – Connect to ActivityPub, ATProto, Nostr, etc.
- **Feed Aggregator** – Normalizes posts from all connected networks.
- **Messaging Layer** – Matrix integration for E2EE chat.
- **Lightning Layer** – Lightning authentication and payments.
- **Storage Drivers** – IPFS, Arweave, or local DBs.

See the [System Diagram](https://github.com/beitmenotyou-com/OmniSocial-ProtocolKit/wiki/Architecture).

---

## 🌐 Supported Protocols

OmniSocial supports:
- ActivityPub (Mastodon, PeerTube)
- AT Protocol (Bluesky)
- Nostr
- Matrix (for messaging)
- RSS (read-only)
- IndieWeb (Micropub, Webmention)
- Webfinger, DIDs

---

## 🪪 Identity Layer

We unify identity across networks with:

- **DIDs** (Decentralized Identifiers)
- **Webfinger** (for federated discovery)
- **Nostr Keys** (automatic generation)
- **Matrix IDs**
- **BridgeID** abstraction layer

User handles follow `@username@domain` format.

---

## 💬 Federated Messaging

OmniSocial uses Matrix for encrypted direct messages and group chat.

- Self-host your own homeserver
- Embedded Element Web UI (optional)
- `@user:yourdomain` handle compatibility

---

## ⚡ Monetization with Lightning

Integrate Lightning for:

- Pay-to-comment / Pay-to-DM
- Paywalls for premium content
- Zaps / Tipping for creators
- Lightning Auth and LNURL-pay

Uses Alby or BTCPay + LND. Learn more in [Lightning Docs](https://github.com/beitmenotyou-com/OmniSocial-ProtocolKit/wiki/Lightning).

---

## 🔌 Plugins & Extensibility

OmniSocial is fully modular:

- Add protocol adapters (e.g. Secure Scuttlebutt)
- Extend moderation tools
- Add new storage backends
- Build custom UI components

Plugin registry coming soon.

---

## 🗂 Decentralized Storage

Users and communities choose where to store content:

- **IPFS** – Content-addressable media
- **Arweave** – Permanent archiving
- **Solid Pods** – For user-controlled data
- **Custom DBs** – SQLite/PostgreSQL supported

---

## 🧵 Unified Feed Engine

OmniSocial unifies posts across:

- Mastodon
- Bluesky
- Nostr
- RSS
- Custom protocols

See and interact with all content in one normalized timeline.
