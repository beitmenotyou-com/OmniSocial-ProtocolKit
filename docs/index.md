# üåê OmniSocial Hub

**OmniSocial Hub** is a community-led, open-source project that unifies multiple decentralized social media protocols into a single gateway.  
It is built by the **Circuitry Hub Insights Collective** to foster self-sovereign communication, federation, and interoperability between protocols like **ActivityPub**, **AT Protocol**, **Nostr**, **DIDs**, and more.

> Think of it as a modular backend + documentation for building cross-protocol federated apps ‚Äî kind of like a decentralized Facebook starter kit.
