# 🌍 Vision

OmniSocial Hub is a starting point — not a finished platform. It’s a shared space for protocol convergence, experimentation, and collective building of a truly federated web.

## 🔭 Long-Term Goals

- Serve as a unified gateway for protocols like ActivityPub, AT Protocol, Nostr, DIDs, Webfinger, and IndieWeb
- Be a developer playground for building bridges, bots, relays, clients, and modular tools
- Allow people to work together on multi-network identity and content federation

## 💡 This is a starter. YOU are the builder.

We welcome proposals, experiments, forks, and federated testbeds.

Built and maintained by the Circuitry Hub Insights Collective.
