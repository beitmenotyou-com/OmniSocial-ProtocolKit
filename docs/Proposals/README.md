# ðŸ“„ OmniSocial Hub Proposals

Welcome to the OmniSocial Hub Proposals Directory.

Here you'll find community-submitted proposals that are either:
- Under review
- Open for discussion
- Pending acceptance
- Archived or rejected (with reasons)

## âœ… How It Works

1. Fork the repository.
2. Copy `PROPOSAL-TEMPLATE.md` into the `/proposals/` folder.
3. Rename the file:  
   Format: `proposal-###-short-title.md`  
   Example: `proposal-003-nostr-mentions.md`
4. Fill in the details using the template.
5. Commit and open a **Pull Request**.
6. The community will review and discuss.
7. Accepted proposals will be moved to `/proposals-accepted/`.

## ðŸ§­ Proposal Status Tags

You can add a YAML header at the top of your file:

```yaml
title: Add Relay-based Nostr Mentions
status: in-review
authors:
  - github: your-username
created: 2025-03-26
