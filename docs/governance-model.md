# 🗳 Governance Model

OmniSocial ProtocolKit is a community-driven project built on the principles of decentralization, transparency, and digital sovereignty. Governance is designed to be modular, forkable, and inclusive — empowering contributors, builders, and collectives to shape its future.

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

- **Transparency** – All decisions and discussions happen in public
- **Community First** – Builders, creators, and users have equal voice
- **Forkability** – Governance is not locked to one structure
- **Protocol > Platform** – We prioritize open standards over centralized services
- **Sovereignty** – You can opt in or out of any governance decisions by self-hosting

---

## 🧠 How Governance Works

Governance is handled collaboratively through the following layers:

### 1. 💬 Public Discussion
All major ideas, proposals, and feature plans are discussed in the [Revolt server](https://revolt.chat/invite/yourlink), GitHub Issues, and the community wiki.

### 2. 📜 Proposals (OSPs)
Anyone can submit an **OmniSocial Proposal (OSP)** via GitHub:
- Describe the idea, motivation, and implementation path
- Label the proposal as `type:feature`, `type:policy`, or `type:protocol`
- Include community feedback and alternatives

Templates are provided in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/proposal.yml`

### 3. ✅ Voting
Community votes are held in the following ways:
- Revolt polls (emoji reactions or Strawpoll-style)
- GitHub discussion threads
- In-platform governance plugins (coming soon)

Votes are non-binding for self-hosted forks but guide official roadmap items.

### 4. 🛠 Implementation
Accepted proposals are tracked in the [Roadmap](https://github.com/beitmenotyou-com/OmniSocial-ProtocolKit/wiki/Roadmap) and built collaboratively. Contributors earn recognition through the Hall of Builders.

## 🧩 Forkable Governance

You don’t have to follow the default governance. Each OmniSocial instance can:
- Set its own moderation and voting rules
- Enable or disable community proposals
- Use plugins to build governance DAOs, multisig, or token voting

**Freedom means control over your own governance model.**
