# ðŸŽ¬ Protocol Hub Walkthrough â€“ Script

**[Intro scene]**
> "Welcome to Protocol Hub â€” the future of federated social media. In this video, Iâ€™ll walk you through the project structure, what it does, and how you can start contributing."

**[Show project repo]**
> "Protocol Hub is an open-source gateway that unites protocols like ActivityPub, AT Protocol, Nostr, Webfinger, Micropub, and DIDs â€” all in one Node.js app."

**[Show folder structure]**
> "It uses Express and TypeScript. Youâ€™ll find separate folders for each protocol under `src/routes`, modular services in `src/services`, and utils to keep code clean."

**[Run the project]**
> "To get started, clone the repo, run `npm install`, and then `npm run dev`. Youâ€™ll see the API running at localhost:4000."

**[Call out endpoints]**
> "Available endpoints include `/activitypub`, `/nostr`, `/webfinger`, and more. You can use them as stubs or build production features on top."

**[Show Docker + CI]**
> "We also support Docker, GitHub Actions for CI, and Vercel/Netlify/Render deploy buttons for one-click hosting."

**[Show README and Docs]**
> "Full documentation is in the `/docs` folder and auto-published via GitHub Pages."

**[End screen]**
> "Thanks for watching! Visit the GitHub repo to join our discussions, contribute proposals, or build your own federated app with Protocol Hub."
