# OmniSocial Hub

**OmniSocial Hub** is a visionary project to build a single platform that unifies decentralized social networks. By integrating **ActivityPub**, **AT Protocol**, and **Nostr**, we're creating a social experience as rich as Facebook â€” but free, sovereign, and federated.

## ðŸš€ What Is OmniSocial Hub?

OmniSocial Hub is an open-source initiative to:

- âœ… Combine the best parts of **Mastodon**, **Bluesky**, and **Nostr**
- âœ… Allow one **user identity** across multiple protocols
- âœ… Deliver a **rich social experience** (feeds, comments, DMs, groups)
- âœ… Let users **own their data** and **host their own instances**

This platform is protocol-agnostic at its core. Post once â€” interact everywhere.

## ðŸ”— Protocols Integrated

| Protocol     | Strengths                                                                 |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ActivityPub** | Standardized federation (Mastodon, PeerTube, etc), mature ecosystem    |
| **AT Protocol** | Portable identity, composable services, strong UX design goals         |
| **Nostr**        | Lightweight, censorship-resistant, cryptographic identity             |

Each protocol will be accessed through a native gateway service, all coordinated by a unified API.
