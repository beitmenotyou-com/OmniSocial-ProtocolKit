# Welcome to OmniSocial Hub

**OmniSocial Hub** is an ambitious project to unify the decentralized social media ecosystem by bridging:

- **ActivityPub** (Mastodon, PeerTube, etc.)
- **AT Protocol** (Bluesky)
- **Nostr** (Relay-based, censorship-resistant)

## What We're Building

A Facebook-like platform â€” but federated, self-hosted, and sovereign.  
You can interact with everyone, across networks, with a single identity.

### Features

- Unified feed from all 3 protocols
- Self-sovereign identity (DIDs or domain-based)
- Plugin-based server architecture
- Web & mobile clients
- Community governance, moderation, messaging, and more

> This is a living idea. Follow our [updates](/updates/2025-03-25.md) as the project evolves.
