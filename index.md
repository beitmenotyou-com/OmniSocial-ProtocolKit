# OmniSocial Hub

**The future of federated social media – one identity, all protocols.**

OmniSocial Hub is a unified, decentralized social platform that bridges:

- **ActivityPub** (Mastodon, PeerTube, etc.)
- **AT Protocol** (Bluesky)
- **Nostr** (Relay-based, censorship-resistant)

## Why OmniSocial?

Imagine a Facebook-like social experience, but:
- **Decentralized** — You control your identity and data.
- **Federated** — Talk to users across different networks.
- **Self-sovereign** — Host it yourself or use a trusted instance.
- **Collaborative** — Built with transparency and community input.

## Project Vision

We're building:

- A **single identity** system based on DIDs or domain names  
- A **multi-protocol content system** for sharing posts across the fediverse  
- A **beautiful web/mobile app** experience that feels modern and intuitive  
- A **developer-friendly gateway** to interact with ActivityPub, AT Protocol, and Nostr from one stack
