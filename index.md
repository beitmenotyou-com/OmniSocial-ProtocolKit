# 🌐 OmniSocial Hub

**OmniSocial Hub** is a federated protocol gateway that combines the best of ActivityPub, AT Protocol, Nostr, IndieWeb, Webfinger, and DIDs — into one powerful and extensible platform.

Built by the **Circuitry Hub Insights Collective**, it empowers developers to build decentralized social media that is censorship-resistant, self-sovereign, and interoperable across networks.
